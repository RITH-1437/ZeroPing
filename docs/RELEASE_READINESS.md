# Release Readiness Report — ZeroPing Framework

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Scope:** Public-release readiness for external developers (framework quality only; ZeroPing Arena excluded).
**Current version:** v1.2.0 (tag pushed; GitHub Release pending — see P0; Packagist package `rith-1437/zeroping` v1.2.0 published).

---

## 1. Status

**Verdict: Ready to promote, with a short list of high-value follow-ups.**

ZeroPing is in good shape for a public launch: the package metadata is
Packagist-valid, the CLI is broad and now documented, the README is accurate and
example-driven, and the test suite is green. The main gaps are (a) a few
documentation pages that the README advertises but that don't yet exist, and
(b) a handful of adoption-critical helpers/examples.

## 2. What was improved in this pass

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Repo URL consistency | Fixed incorrect `RITH-1437/zero-ping` references introduced in v1.2.0 → correct `RITH-1437/ZeroPing` (GitHub) while keeping `rith-1437/zeroping` (Packagist package). Affected README, `docs/website/installation.md`, `docs/index.html`, `Console.php` help, `AboutCommand.php`. |
| Packagist metadata | Confirmed `composer validate --strict` passes. `type: project`, declared `ext-*`, `bin: zero`, `post-create-project-cmd`, keywords, license, authors, support links all present. |
| README | Added **Quick Start** (route → controller → view), **Project Structure**, **CLI Usage**, and **Examples** sections; added a **Community** section linking Discussions/Issues/Security. |
| CLI docs | Rewrote `docs/website/cli.md` to list all commands, including `doctor`, `make:test`, `make:command`, all `make:*`, and the `dashboard` template. |
| CLI help accuracy | Fixed `view:cache` description (was "Compile all Blade templates"; the framework uses plain-PHP views, not Blade). |
| GitHub templates | Replaced the ineffective legacy `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` with a proper `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory (`bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`, `config.yml` routing questions to Discussions and security reports privately). Improved `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with a testing checklist. |
| Community | Added Discussions guidance to `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `config.yml`. |
| Coding standards | Added `.editorconfig` (PSR-12-aligned) to help contributors. |
| Examples plan | Added `docs/EXAMPLES.md` describing shipped templates and proposed demo apps. |
| Verification | `composer validate --strict` → valid; **240 unit tests pass** (516 assertions). |

## 3. Documentation completeness gap (P1)

The README states docs cover routing, the container, database, ORM, validation,
caching, queues, scheduling, security, testing, and deployment. The actual
`docs/website/` set only contains:

`api.md`, `cli.md`, `getting-started.md`, `installation.md`, `introduction.md`,
`performance.md`, `roadmap.md`, `search.md`, `starter-templates.md`, `validation.md`.

**Missing core pages:** routing, container / DI, database & schema, ORM / models,
caching, queues, scheduler, security, testing, deployment, configuration,
templating/helpers, and error handling. These should be authored before broad
promotion, or the README's claims should be scoped down until they exist.

## 4. Suggested missing framework features (lightweight, high adoption value)

Prioritized by impact-vs-weight, all consistent with ZeroPing's "zero magic,
no required runtime dependencies" philosophy:

- **P1 — `asset()` / `url()` view helpers.** Web developers expect them; currently only `view()`, `route()`, `e()`, `config()`, `env()`, `base_path()` exist. Tiny, high-impact.
- **P1 — Auth starter / `make:auth`.** Registration, login/logout, password hashing, and a route-middleware example are the single most-requested boilerplate. Highest leverage for adoption.
- **P1 — Lightweight HTTP test client + assertions.** `tests/TestCase` has output/request helpers but no `get()`/`post()` test client or `assertSee()`-style assertions, making feature tests awkward.
- **P2 — Model factories.** Seeders exist (`db:seed`, `make:seeder`); factories would make tests far easier to write.
- **P2 — `env:validate` / required-env check in `doctor`.** Fail fast with a clear message when a required `DB_*`/app var is missing.
- **P2 — Friendly error pages.** `PrettyException` exists; ensure a clean 404/500 view path is wired for production.
- **P3 — Optional HTTP client & localization.** Useful but add surface area; defer until demand is clear.

## 5. Prioritized recommendations

### P0 — do before broad promotion
1. **Create the v1.2.0 GitHub Release** from the pushed tag (blocked in the previous session: no `gh` CLI / token in this environment). The tag `v1.2.0` is already pushed.
 2. **Verify `composer create-project` end-to-end** — *Done:* the CI `create-project` job now runs the **real** `composer create-project rith-1437/zeroping` (install → `post-create-project.php` → boot on port 1437 → smoke test). Validated locally via a real download from Packagist — install, key generation, and `php zero serve` all succeed (HTTP 200).
 3. **Submit/confirm the Packagist package** `rith-1437/zeroping` — *Published.* v1.2.0 is live on Packagist (verified via `repo.packagist.org/p2/rith-1437/zeroping.json`). README Option A now works; GitHub auto-update webhook should be enabled so future tags sync automatically.
4. **Set the discussion category** on GitHub and confirm the `config.yml` contact links resolve.

### P1 — adoption-critical
5. Author the missing core doc pages listed in §3 (start with routing, container, database/ORM, testing).
6. Add `asset()`/`url()` helpers and the auth starter/template.
7. Add the HTTP test client + assertions.
8. Document the public API surface explicitly (what's stable, what's internal under `App\Core`).

### P2 — polish / maintainability
9. Adopt `php-cs-fixer` (or Pint) with a CI lint job to enforce the PSR-12 standard already stated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
10. Extend `doctor` with required-env validation; add model factories.
11. Add at least one additional example app from `docs/EXAMPLES.md`.

## 6. Verification performed

- `composer validate --strict` → **valid**
- `vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite unit` → **240 tests, 516 assertions, OK**
- `php -l` on all modified PHP files → clean
- Manual check: CLI `about`, `doctor`, `make:test`, `make:command`, `serve [port]` behave as documented.

## 7. Open risks

- The `post-create-project-cmd` installer **has** now been validated through a real `composer create-project rith-1437/zeroping` run (install, key generation, boot on port 1437, HTTP 200). The remaining CI-side risk is only that the webhook hadn't yet propagated at first publish; future tags should auto-sync via the Packagist GitHub webhook.
- Documentation over-claims coverage (§3). Either fill the pages or narrow the README's promises.
- No static analysis (PHPStan/Psalm) or coverage gate in CI.
